<h1> New York taxi trips duration </h1>

The objective of this project is to better understand and explain some useful techniques of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning, and try to achieve a good performance in training, testing, and submiting a outcome to Kaggle competition. for the sake of doing that, we are going to use the New York City Trip Duration competition , you guys can find the complete briefing of it by clicking <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/overview">Here</a>.

Required datasets:
* <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/data" >Download Taxi City Trip Duration Dataset</a>
* <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WIWwC4F3ITnuW7xk0hPomQgYq35OVsaN/view?usp=sharing">Complementary Dataset of Taxi Trips</a>
* <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kfRBRtaX-g8HjGvY3kmoWIu2H3x4_ZHE/view?usp=sharing">Weather dataset of New York in 2016</a>

You can find the complete notebook by clicking <a href="https://github.com/nicholascomuni/Kaggle-New-York-Taxi-Copetition/blob/master/NY%20Taxi.ipynb">Here</a>

The notebook is divided in 2 parts - 1st. Exploratory Data Analysis, where we sought to explore the dataset with fancy plots and techniques.
And the 2nd. Machine Learning, where we trained our model with a XGBoost Regressor and predicted the competition outcomes.
